\subsection{Basic Coding Framework}

Setup up the coding framework on GitHub.
The project framework will be based on Stable-Baselines3 and other packages.

\subsection{Version 1: An RL agent with two different Mlp modules}

The simplest case, there are two different Mlp modules.
The agent would make decision based on the concatenation of the activations of these two modules.
The system will then test on single-body locomotion task.

\subsection{Version 2: An RL agent with two different RNN modules}

Replace two Mlp modules with two different RNN modules.
It will be nice if they have different time scales.

\subsection{Version 3: An RL agent with 2 RNN + 2 Mlp}

Combine Mlp and RNN modules together to produce a better abstraction of the observations.
The system will then be tested on multi-body locomotion task.

The performance of different versions will be compared.
